SwiftPath User Insight Tag
=======================

Place this tag in the HTML of the pages you wish to measure. We recommend placing it just before the closing `</body>` tag

It will automatically send information to a secure data cloud which can then be used for better route optimisation

For further information, see the SwiftServe manual or raise an issue/ticket.
